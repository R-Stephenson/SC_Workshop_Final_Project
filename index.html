        They're probably not your best friend but, personally, I've no problem
        making thier acquaintance...

        I am a recent graduate of Geology and admittedly I was surprised at how
        interesting I found diamonds to be. I'll be honest with you, and you may
        very well know this already; diamonds aren't 'rare' to mean
        <em>there aren't many</em> - Yes, their surficial occurance is discrete
        and limited but where they have survived the treacherous journey to the
        (near)surface, they are aplenty!

        The 4 C's, as they're known in industry: Colour, Cut, Clarity and Carat,
        are not what sparked my interest, but rather the utterly impossible
        conditions necessary for the formation of this gem. And so, for my
        project, I thought to celebrate the diamond not for its glitz and worth,
        but as a natural marvel, where each individual gem has an average age of
        between 1.5 and 3 billion years old! Illustrated

        and <em>below</em> are 2 ways diamond can be
        <strong>synthetically created</strong> in a lab.
